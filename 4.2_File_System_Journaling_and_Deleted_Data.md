## **1. Introduction to Journaling in Linux File Systems**
### **What is Journaling?**
- Journaling is a mechanism used by file systems to **keep track of changes** before committing them permanently.
- It prevents data corruption and ensures file system integrity after **power failures, system crashes, or improper shutdowns**.
- The journal logs file system transactions and replays them if a failure occurs.

### **Why is Journaling Important?**
| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Prevents Data Corruption** | Ensures consistency even after crashes |
| **Speeds Up Recovery** | Quick system restoration without fsck |
| **Improves Stability** | Metadata integrity is maintained |

### **How Journaling Works?**
1. A **journal entry** is written before changes are applied.
2. The system commits the changes to disk.
3. Once changes are successfully written, the journal entry is removed.
4. In case of failure, Linux replays the journal to restore the system.

## **2. Types of Journaling in Linux**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Writeback Journaling** | Only metadata is journaled, fastest but can lead to data inconsistency |
| **Ordered Journaling** | Metadata is journaled first, followed by actual data (default in Ext4) |
| **Full Journaling** | Both metadata and file data are journaled before changes are applied (used in XFS, Btrfs) |

### **Enabling Journaling on a File System**
```bash
tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/sda1
```

## **3. Journal Tools and File System Recovery**

### **Common Linux Tools for Journaling and Recovery**

#### **1. fsck (File System Check)**
- Used to check and repair file system errors.
```bash
fsck /dev/sda1
fsck -y /dev/sda1  # Auto-fix errors
```

#### **2. tune2fs (Modify File System Parameters)**
- Used to enable/disable journaling in ext file systems.
```bash
tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/sda1
```

#### **3. debugfs (Inspect File System Internals)**
- Used to access and manipulate file system metadata.
```bash
debugfs /dev/sda1
```

#### **4. journalctl (View Journal Logs in systemd)**
- Used to check system logs related to file system activity.
```bash
journalctl -xe
```

## **4. Deleted Data and File Recovery**
### **How Does Linux Handle Deleted Files?**
- When a file is deleted, only its **inode reference** is removed, but the data remains on the disk **until overwritten**.
- **Deleted files can be recovered** if no new data has replaced them.

### **Where to Find Deleted File Information?**
| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| **Inodes** | Stored in `/proc` or `/sys` |
| **File System Journal** | Stores recent changes before deletion |
| **Log Files** | `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog` |

## **5. Tools for Recovering Deleted Files**

### **1. extundelete (Recover Deleted Files from ext3/ext4)**
```bash
sudo apt install extundelete
extundelete /dev/sda1 --list-deleted
extundelete /dev/sda1 --restore-file /home/user/deleted.txt
```

### **2. testdisk (Recover Lost Partitions and Files)**
```bash
sudo apt install testdisk
sudo testdisk
```
- Navigate the interface to recover files.

### **3. photorec (Recover Deleted Media Files)**
```bash
sudo apt install photorec
sudo photorec
```
- Select partition and start recovery.

## **6. Hands-on Practice Commands**
### **Check File System Journal**
```bash
tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep -i journal
```
### **List Deleted Files in ext4**
```bash
extundelete /dev/sda1 --list-deleted
```
### **Recover a Deleted File**
```bash
testdisk
```

## **7. Summary**
- Journaling prevents file system corruption and speeds up recovery.  
- Different file systems (Ext3, Ext4, XFS, Btrfs) use different journaling methods.  
- Linux does not immediately erase deleted files, allowing recovery before overwriting.  
- Tools like `fsck`, `extundelete`, `testdisk`, and `photorec` help restore lost files.  

## **8. Practice**
1. Identify the journaling method used in your system using:
```bash
tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep -i journal
```
2. Delete and try recovering a file using `testdisk`.
3. Check journal logs using:
```bash
journalctl -xe
```
